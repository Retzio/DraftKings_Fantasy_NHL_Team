# DraftKings_Fantasy_NHL_Team

I created a DraftKings NHL fantasy lineup using GLPK Solver. 
For the DraftKings NHL fatasy lineup contest you are a given a set of constrainst to build a fantasy team. 
To view all the rules, points, and contraints, see DraftKings. Using GLPK I created the best posiible team based each player's current season stats. 
Becuase this was just for fun and based on a contest that had alreadt happened, I created a second lineup for what the best possible team would have been based on the games for the contest.
